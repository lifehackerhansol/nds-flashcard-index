## What are flashcarts?

Flashcarts are unlicensed cartridges for video game consoles. These cartridges allow the ability to run game backups and other homebrew.

## What will I do in this guide?

- Download the System Files required for your flashcart.
- Download a cheat database for retail ROMs.
- Set up TWiLight Menu++ on your flashcard for emulators.

By following our guide, you will have the most up to date setup for enhancing your Nintendo DS games. As a bonus, you can launch into TWiLight Menu++ to have an all-in-one menu for a variety of different emulators and an enhanced homebrew launcher.

## What can I do by using a flashcard?

- Run most of the entries in the Nintendo DS library.
- Use cheat codes to enhance your experience.
- Emulate old-time classics with a menu that can access all your favorite emulators.
- Turn your device into a media player with Moonshell.
- Manage your SD card using GodMode9i.
- Run unofficial Nintendo DS Homebrew from devs across the scene.

## What should I know before starting?

- There is literally no way to brick a flashcard unless you modify your firmware (which we won't be covering in this tutorial), or if you run kernels that are not designed for that specific card.
- Excluding Flashme (which only works on DS Phat/Lite), there is no homebrew that could brick your Nintendo DS.
- If your flashcart boots into "An error has occured", the prefered way to fix it would be to install custom firmware on your console.
  - [Nintendo 3DS CFW Guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide)
  - [Nintendo DSi CFW Guide](https://dsi.cfw.guide) (make sure to use Unlaunch's SLOT-1 launcher to launch the card)
- For flashcarts too old to be detected and launched, you could use [NTR Launcher](https://github.com/ApacheThunder/NTR_Launcher/releases) to launch into them.
- Some kernels may have what's called a Time Bomb. You could use YSMenu to work around that when the time comes.
- Some flashcarts can only launch homebrew. You can use Bootstrap 4 DS (which comes with TWiLight Menu++) to work around that.

Get started by [selecting your kernel](setup).
